ðŸ“˜ Student Record Analyzer
This C++ program is a console-based Student Record Analyzer that manages academic records using object-oriented design and file handling. It supports:
- Displaying all student records in a formatted table
- Identifying the topper based on highest marks
- Calculating average marks
- Sorting records by marks (descending)
- Searching students by name
- Adding and removing student records
- Exporting data to CSV format
Student data is stored in students.txt and can be exported to exported_students.csv. The program uses a menu-driven interface and the Student class to encapsulate roll number, name, and marks.
